# ledgible

Formatter for hledger journals. This is **not** ready for production use.

## Roadmap

In no particular order:

- [ ] Check other defaults for ledger location
- [ ] Fully conform to ledger journal standard
- [ ] Standardize dates
- [ ] Per-currency/commodity formatting
- [ ] Expand tabs
- [ ] Parse split amounts for improved formatting
- [ ] Use user preference for `,` versus `.` in numbers
- [x] Write output to file
- [x] Read from stdin by default
- [x] Standardize split amounts
